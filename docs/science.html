<a href='#Evaluating Planck Likelihoods'><h1 id='Evaluating Planck Likelihoods'>Evaluating planck likelihoods</h1></a>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck spacecraft</a> is a satellite built to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background, the microwave radiation reaching us from the edge of the observable universe. Its goal is to detect tiny fluctuations (on the scale of 1 part in 100,000) of this radiation from different directions.
<br>
We use these observations to compare out theoretical models to reality. But because those fluctuations are based on randomness (quantum fluctuations in the early universe) we cannot predict the actual pattern on the sky. What we can predict, and test, are certain statistical properties. Most commonly we use the <i>multipoles</i> (usually referred to as the power spectrum) -- what are those? They describe how correlated or different the radiation in directions looks, e.g. <i>dipole</i> relating to the correlation of opposite directions. Another way to think of this is the correlation of two directions at a certain (angular) distance. The dipole describes correlation of points 180 degrees apart, quadrupole 90 degrees etc. The 180th moment describes points separated by an angle of just 1 degree and this turns out to be the "strongest" correlation. In simple terms, we could say the circumstances in the early universe allowed matter and energy to travel such that spots about 40 million light years apart were very correlated.
</p>

<p>For my work I frequently compute this power spectrum and compare it to the observations of Planck. For most of my work I used the code <a href="https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya">cobaya</a> which automatically performs the calculation internally and returns the likelihood of a set of parameters being compatible with the Planck observations. One day I ran a model which was not included in cobaya, so I had to compute the likelihood myself and found surprisingly little documentation on the likelihood.
<br>
I did some <s>reverse-engineering</s>reading of the <a href="https://github.com/marius311/cosmoslik">cosmoslik wrapper</a> to find out how it works, and want to write about the results here. But before I continue, if you just want to get the likelihood of a given power spectrum use cosmoslik's <code>cosmoslik.likelihoods</code> module! Simply pass a dictionary of power spectra and you get the corresponding loglikelihood value.
</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity though, I wanted to figure out how exactly I can use the Planck likelihoods without any external programs, also to make sure that the wrapper was still functioning. <a href="https://github.com/marius311/cosmoslik/blob/master/cosmoslik_plugins/likelihoods/planck/clik.py">cosmoslik's code</a> turned out to be very helpful and largely what this is based on. So here's my writeup of how to use the clik python code (this is still a wrapper for the C &amp; Fortran code but since it comes together with the likelihood code from the Planck team I won't dig deeper here). Firstly, assuming you have installed the likelihood and sourced the <code>clik_profile</code> script, you can import the clik python module and load a clik likelihood file:</p>
<pre><code>from clik import clik
lowT = clik(&quot;/path/to/baseline/plc_3.0/low_l/commander/commander_dx12_v3_2_29.clik&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now the function <code>lowT</code> can be called with a list as argument and returns the likelihood. To figure out which values to put in the list, we use the function <code>lowT.get_lmax()</code>. The former returns <code>(29, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1)</code> indicating it requires the TT spectra from l=0 to 29. The list maps to <code>(TT, EE, BB, TE, ?, ?)</code> where the latter two should be <code>TB</code> and <code>EB</code> but I'm not sure about the order.
Next use <code>lowT.get_extra_parameter_names()</code> to get the nuisance parameters that need to be appended to the list, in this case <code>('A_planck',)</code>.</p>
<p>First let us get the power spectra, e.g. from <a href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public">CLASS</a></p>
<pre><code>from classy import Class
cosmo = Class()
cosmo.set({'output': 'tCl pCl lCl', 'lensing': 'yes'})
cosmo.compute()
Cell = cosmo.lensed_cl()
</code></pre>
<p>Note that CLASS returns the power spectra in relative units while the likelihoods require absolute units (see Julien Lesgourgues's comment <a href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/issues/322#issuecomment-613941965">here</a> for some context), so we convert to uKÂ² by multiplying by the mean CMB temperature squared.</p>
<pre><code>Tcmb = 2.7255*1e6 #uK
Cl_TT = Cell['tt']*Tcmb**2
</code></pre>
<p>Also note that we just use the power spectrum C_ell, not the modified version D_ell. The latter is used as input for <code>cosmoslik</code>.</p>
<p>Finally we can call the likelihood with a list of spectra and nuisance parameters:</p>
<pre><code>A_planck = 1.000442
lowT([*Cl_TT[:30], A_planck])
</code></pre>
<p>For something close to bestfit LCDM the result should be around -12.</p>
<p>For a more complex example, let's look at the high-l TTTEEE likelihood. <code>highTTTEEE.lmax</code> shows us we need (2508, 2508, -1, 2508, -1, -1), i.e. the TT, EE and TE spectra, and in that order. <code>highTTTEEE.extra_parameter_names</code> lists a whopping 47 nuisance parameters which we have to pass in the right order as well.
Tipp: You can get those in the right order from a dictionary wit something like <code>nuisance_TTTEEE = [planck_nuisance_array[p] for p in highTTTEEE.extra_parameter_names]</code>.
Finally <code>highTTTEEE(Cl_TT[:2509]+Cl_EE[:2509]+Cl_TE[:2509]+nuisance_TTTEEE)</code> should return something like -1173, again for LCDM.</p>

<p>[<em>My project for <a href="https://www.eacambridge.org/technical-alignment-curriculum">AGI Safety Fundamentals programme</a> (~Oct 2021). Code &amp; pictures below. Cross-posted <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/raRSW3e9iYMwkqjBX/cnn-feature-visualization-in-50-lines-of-code">here</a>.</em>]</p>
<p>To me, reading about <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/">Feature Visualization</a> felt like one of the most revealing insights about CNNs in the last years. Seeing the idea &quot;this node finds eyes, this node finds mouths, the combination detects faces&quot; (oversimplified) actually implemented by the CNN was a pleasant surprise, as in, it suggests we might actually understand how NNs work. There&#39;s more reading on the <a href="https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-week-6">programme website here</a>, I can highly recommend the articles by <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/">Chris Olah&#39;s group on distill</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing this I think many of us immediately want to try this, and play around with it. There is of course the OpenAI <a href="https://microscope.openai.com/models">Microscope</a> to look at results, and the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid">Lucid</a> library, but I wanted to actually reproduce the idea myself without relying on a somewhat black box (big library / OpenAI Microscope).</p>
<p>Almost all tutorials I found however used Lucid, and this really cool write-up <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-visualize-convolutional-features-in-40-lines-of-code-70b7d87b0030">&quot;How to visualize convolutional features in 40 lines of code&quot;</a> unfortunately starts with <code>from fastai.conv_learner import *</code>. In retrospective I think I could understand this now, but I didn&#39;t, and finding out which parts were fastai functions and what they do was rather tricky. I also didn&#39;t manage to install the required (older) version of fastai.</p>
<p>So I decided to have a go myself, and, luckily, I found that &quot;DeepDream&quot; is based a very similar idea and I could adopt most code from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/deepdream">this notebook</a> from Google AI. This isn&#39;t actually too complicated, especially broken down to the bare minimum:</p>
<ol>
<li>A trained network whose features we want to visualize</li>
<li>A loop to maximize the activation of a targeted node</li>
<li>A few lines to make and show an image.</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole code runs in about a minute on my laptop (no GPU).</p>
<p>1) The first part is easy, we get the pre-trained network from tensorflow.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">import tensorflow as tf
base_model = tf<span class="hljs-selector-class">.keras</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.applications</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.VGG19</span>(include_top=False, weights=<span class="hljs-string">'imagenet'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>2) The next part in the code (it&#39;s mostly comments really), see the comments marked with <code>#</code> for explanations:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">def maximize_activation(starting_img,\
                        <span class="hljs-attr">target_layer="mixed0",</span> <span class="hljs-attr">target_index=0,\</span>
                        <span class="hljs-attr">steps=10,</span> <span class="hljs-attr">step_size=0.1):</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment"># Take the network and cut it off at the layer we want to analyze,</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># i.e. we only need the part from the input to the target_layer.</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">target</span> = [base_model.get_layer(target_layer).output]
    <span class="hljs-attr">part_model</span> = tf.keras.Model(<span class="hljs-attr">inputs=base_model.input,</span> <span class="hljs-attr">outputs=target)</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment"># The next part is the function to maximize the target layer/node by</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># adjusting the input, equivalent to the usual gradient descent but</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># gradient ascent. Run an optimization loop:</span>
    def gradient_ascent(img, steps, step_size):
        <span class="hljs-attr">loss</span> = tf.constant(<span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>)
        for n <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> tf.range(steps):
            <span class="hljs-comment"># As in normal NN training, you want to record the computation</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment"># of the forward-pass (the part_model call below) to compute the</span>

            <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                tape.watch(img)

                <span class="hljs-attr">activation</span> = part_model(tf.expand_dims(img, <span class="hljs-attr">axis=0))</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># The activation will be of shape (1,N,N,L) where N is related to</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># the resolution of the input image (assuming our target layer is</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># a convolutional filter), and L is the size of the layer. E.g. for a</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># 256x256 image in "block4_conv1" of VGG19, this will be</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># (1,32,32,512) -- we select one of the 512 nodes (index) and</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># average over the rest (you can average selectively to affect</span>
                <span class="hljs-comment"># only part of the image but there's not really a point):</span>
                <span class="hljs-attr">loss</span> = tf.math.reduce_mean(activation[:,:,:,target_index])

            <span class="hljs-comment"># Get the gradient, i.e. derivative of "loss" with respect to input</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment"># and normalize.</span>
            <span class="hljs-attr">gradients</span> = tape.gradient(loss, img)
            gradients /= tf.math.reduce_std(gradients)

            <span class="hljs-comment"># In the final step move the image in the direction of the gradient to</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment"># increate the "loss" (our targeted activation). Note that the sign here</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment"># is opposite to the typical gradient descent (our "loss" is the target </span>
            <span class="hljs-comment"># activation which we maximize, not something we minimize).</span>
            <span class="hljs-attr">img</span> = img + gradients*step_size
            <span class="hljs-attr">img</span> = tf.clip_by_value(img, -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
        return loss, img

    <span class="hljs-comment"># Preprocessing of the image (converts from [0..255] to [-1..1]</span>

    return img
</code></pre>
<p>3) Finally apply this procedure to a random image:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">import</span> numpy as np
<span class="hljs-built_in">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot as plt

<span class="hljs-attr">starting_img</span> = np.random.randint(<span class="hljs-attr">low=0,high=255,size=(300,300,3),</span> <span class="hljs-attr">dtype=np.uint8)</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">optimized_img</span> = maximize_activation(starting_img, <span class="hljs-attr">target_layer="block4_conv1",</span> <span class="hljs-attr">target_index=47,</span> <span class="hljs-attr">steps=10,</span> <span class="hljs-attr">step_size=0.1)</span>
plt.imshow(np.array(optimized_img))
</code></pre><p>And here we go!</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/tensorflow-feature-extraction-tutorial/blob/main/images/img01.png?raw=true" alt="generated image"></p>
<p>Looks like features. Now let&#39;s try to reproduce one of the OpenAI microscope images, node 4 of layer block4_conv1 -- here is my version:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/tensorflow-feature-extraction-tutorial/blob/main/images/img02.png?raw=true" alt="OpenAI Microscope reproduction"></p>
<p>And the OpenAI Microscope image:</p>
<p><img src="https://oaiggoh.blob.core.windows.net/microscopeprod/2020-07-25/2020-07-25/vgg19_caffe/lucid.feature_vis/_feature_vis/alpha%3DFalse%26negative%3DFalse%26objective%3Dchannel%26op%3Dconv4_1%252Fconv4_1%253A0%26repeat%3D0%26start%3D0%26steps%3D4096%26stop%3D32/channel-4.png" alt="OpenAI Microscope original"></p>
<p>Not identical, but clearly the same feature in both visualizations!</p>
<p>Finally here is a run with InceptionV3, just for the pretty pictures, this time starting with a non-random (black) image. And an animation of the image after every iteration.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/tensorflow-feature-extraction-tutorial/raw/main/image.png" alt="final image">
<img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/tensorflow-feature-extraction-tutorial/raw/main/image.gif" alt="animation"></p>
<p>Note: There&#39;s an <em>optional</em> bit to improve the speed (by about a factor of 2 on my laptop), just add this decorator in front of the <code>gradient_ascent</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>    @tf.function(
        <span class="hljs-comment"># Decorator to increase the speed of the gradient_ascent function</span>

          tf.TensorSpec(<span class="hljs-attr">shape=[],</span> <span class="hljs-attr">dtype=tf.float32),)</span>
    )
    def gradient_ascent(img, steps, step_size): ...

<p>This is basically how far I got in the time, the code can be found on my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/tensorflow-feature-extraction-tutorial/blob/main/short_version.ipynb">link</a>). But I do plan to look at some more interpretability techniques (maybe something for transformers or RL?) or more general AGI Safety ideas in the future!</p>
<p>Feel free to post a comment or send me a message if you have any questions or anything really, happy to chat about these things!</p>
<p><em>I just want to thank the organizers of the AGI Safety Fundamentals programme again, for setting up the programme and all their support.
