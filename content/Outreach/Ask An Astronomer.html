<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>On Monday evenings, a colleague and I sit down in front of a camera and chat about astronomy, mostly answering questions from viewers all around the world. I started this project in April 2020 as everybody was suck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic but plan to continue various online activities in the future.</p>
<p><b>Note: Currently not running, but there is lots of other content on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CambridgeUniversityAstronomy">YouTube channel</a>!</b></p>
<p>We answer everything we can about astronomy and physics but also science and life as a researcher in general. Even though we sometimes digress a bit we want to make this accessible to everybody – so ask us anything you want to know or don’t understand. There are no stupid questions!</p>
<p>You can find us roughly every second Monday on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/CambridgeUniversityAstronomy">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/AskScience_IoA">Periscope</a>.
	In the meantime, why not take a look at our special stream celebrating the 25th episode <a href="https://youtu.be/aYmqrlVqFu8?t=22">here</a> or the most recent (as of 31.12.2020) episode <a href="https://youtu.be/k4GnKtIDIeQ?t=14">here</a>! For a cosmology-focused version I can recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBAtZqfKF24">this recording</a> where we got 10 participants from the Cosmology from Home conference answering questions from YouTube and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/imdw7e/askscience_ama_series_we_are_cosmologists_experts/">Reddit</a>.
	We also announce all live streams on <a href="https://twitter.com/AskScience_IoA">Twitter</a> so please follow us to receive notifications ;-)</p>
<h2>Can I view old live streams</h2>
<p>Definitively! All our live streams are recorded and uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHC3xLEuCSA&amp;list=PLg8xO7lp9qSNC3bSB0vDRGdDnT03efquJ">YouTube</a> and Periscope. Note that the numbering on YouTube and Periscope is slightly different for the first few streams but everything from episode 6 should be consistent.</p>
<h2>Can I participate?</h2>
<p>I’m always looking for participants, just drop me an email and we can arrange something. I'm happy to try out new ideas so please do reach out!</p>
