<p>Using my <a href="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/tensorflow-feature-extraction-tutorial/">feature extraction</a> script I analyzed 
node <code>4</code> in the <code>block5_conv4</code> layer of <code>VGG19</code>:</p>

        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:

<h2 id="theconfusingpart">The confusing part</h2>

<p>Judging my the <a href="https://microscope.openai.com/models/vgg19_caffe/conv5_4_conv5_4_0/4">OpenAI Microscope</a> it looks like the node mostly gets activated by furry animals -- <em>in the training set</em>. Of course our image in artificial and this far outside the usual distribution, and we can expect such different behaviour. But why do we get the <code>sea_cucumber</code> prediction, rather than predictions of <code>dog</code>, <code>bison</code> or <code>lion</code>?</p>

<p>Feeding this image into the network, it seems insanely sure that the right label is <code>sea_cucumber</code>. Also other imagenet-trained networks such as Inception or VGG16 give the same result. Note: This was not indended and not optimized for.</p>

<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>

<p>Let's look at the activations, after feeding the image into the VGG19 network I have been using:</p>

<pre><code class="python language-python">target = [model_vgg19.get_layer("block5_conv4").output]
model_vgg19_cutoff = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model_vgg19.input, outputs=target)
x = tf.keras.applications.vgg19.preprocess_input(np.expand_dims(img, axis=0))
activations = model_vgg19_cutoff.predict(x)
plt.plot(np.mean(np.mean(np.mean(activations, axis=0), axis=0), axis=0))
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/sea_cucumber_essence/blob/main/activations.png?raw=true" width=100% class="center" />
So the question we're asking, is this the typical pattern for a dog or bison? Or maybe closer to the <code>sea_cucumber</code> pattern, in this 512-dimensional space?</p>

<p>Let's have a look at the <code>groenendael</code> (1st image in Microscope) and <code>sea_cucumber</code> classes, as well as a few randomly selected ones. I downloaded the imagenet data and used <a href="https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2017/browse-synsets.php">this list</a> to find the right files.
<img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/sea_cucumber_essence/blob/main/groenendael.png?raw=true" width=100% class="center" />
Hmm I don't really see a pattern by eye here, nor a similarity to above / excitation in index 4. In hindsight this makes sense, we wouldn't expect the category to be simply 1-hot encoded in activation space, because a) there is not enough room, and b) there are more layers following so I would rather think of some clusters in the high dimensional activation space. Let's maybe look some summary statistic, like the absolute distance in this 512-dim vector space.</p>

<p>So I take the training images, feed them into the network and read of the activations of the 512 nodes in the layer we are looking at (averaged over the 14x14 locations). Then I compute the distance as absolute distance between the vectors, 512-dimenisonal L2 norm.
The image below shows the distance between the optimized "sea_cucumber essence" image and the activations of <code>sea_cucumber</code> training data (green), <code>groenendael</code> (blue), and a mix of 10 random classes (100 random images each). The blue curve shows the average activation-distance between randomly selected images of different classes. The code for all the following plots can be found in <code>code_distances.py</code>.
<img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/sea_cucumber_essence/blob/main/activation_distances_node4maximized.png?raw=true" alt="distances" width=100% class="center"/></p>

<p>For context, here is the average distance between randomly selected images (grey), images from the same class (red) and images from different classes (blue):
<img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/sea_cucumber_essence/blob/main/activation_distances_general.png?raw=true" width=60% class="center" />
We learn three main things here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generally images of the same class seem to be nearer to each other in this 512-dim space than random / different classes, but the effect is not very strong. Of course we wouldn't expect that the distance is the best measure of "closeness" between activations.</li>

<li>These numbers are all waaaay smaller than the ~7k and 36k we get from the "sea_cucumber essence" image. This tells us (somewhat unsurprisingly) that that optimized image is far outside the training distribution in at least this measure.</li>

<li>The <code>sea_cucumber</code> training data seems to give activations <em>slightly</em> closer to the "sea_cucumber essence" image -- so maybe it's just far outside the distribution but into the <code>sea_cucumber</code> direction?</li>
</ol>

<p>Naturally the L2-distance isn't the ideal way to reduce the 512-d space into something plot-able. One method I found is <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html">t-SNE</a> which projects the 512-dimensions into two parameters which we can plot:
<img src="https://github.com/Stefan-Heimersheim/sea_cucumber_essence/blob/main/tSNE.png?raw=true" width=100% class="center" />
Looks like we get a nice separation (t-SNE does not know the labels) of different categories, and the "sea_cucumber essence" activations tend to lie within the <code>sea_cucumber</code> training data!</p>

<p>This doesn't definitely answer the question, but I think it's clear that this node4-maximized image ends up in a corner of parameter space which, even though it is "far away" (L2 distance), lies in a region that is clearly near the region that <code>sea_cucumber</code> training images lie in. Presented with this out-of-distribution image, and tasked with choosing between only the existing categories, the network decides for <code>sea_cucumber</code>.</p>
