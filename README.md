# My website
This repository contains the files for my website at [stefan-heimersheim.github.io](https://stefan-heimersheim.github.io/index.html).
Note that the actual html files are found in `docs/` as this is the only subfolder name available for GitHub pages.
The `templates/` directory contains the html skeleton for the sites while the main content is found in `content/`.
The python script `build.py` combines those files to create the html files in `docs/`.
Finally build is automated using GitHub Actions, the corresponding configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/`.

If you want to do something like this yourself but have some questions feel free to drop me a line!
